# t4-4_kmedoids
This project is part of the module 'Data Science 1' at Goethe University, Frankfurt, and was developed by group t4-4 in the summer term of 2021.

## The project
Within this project, a data analysis of three classified data sets is performed using three variants of the kmedoids algorithm. The goal is to have the algorithm correctly assign 
the data points to their right cluster. This is tested by three common cluster validation indices. These compute varying scores to give an indication whether the algorithm performed
clustering of data well.

The algorithms are distinct in their underlying distance measure, by which the algorithm computes distances between each data point. Upon this information, the algorithms can
build varying clusters.

The distance metrics  eligible are:

- Euclidean
- Chebyshev
- Mahalanobis

The data sets eligible are:

- Red Wine Quality (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality, winequality-red.csv)
- Wine Classification (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine)
- Iris Flower Classification (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris)

The cluster validation indices eligible are:

- Sum of Squared Errors (SSE)
- Rand Index
- Silhouette Coefficient
